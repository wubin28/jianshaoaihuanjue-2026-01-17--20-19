❯ /speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and
performance requirements

● I'll help you create a project constitution focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Let me start by reading the existing template.

● Read(.specify/memory/constitution.md)
  ⎿  Read 51 lines

● Read(.specify/templates/plan-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 105 lines

● Read(.specify/templates/spec-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 116 lines

● Read(.specify/templates/tasks-template.md)
  ⎿  Read 252 lines

● Now let me check for any command templates and README files for context.

● Search(pattern: ".specify/templates/commands/*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files

● Read(README.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Based on my analysis, I've identified all placeholder tokens in the constitution template:
  - [PROJECT_NAME]
  - [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME], [PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
  - [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME], [PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
  - [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME], [PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
  - [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME], [PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
  - [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME], [PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
  - [SECTION_2_NAME], [SECTION_2_CONTENT]
  - [SECTION_3_NAME], [SECTION_3_CONTENT]
  - [GOVERNANCE_RULES]
  - [CONSTITUTION_VERSION], [RATIFICATION_DATE], [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]

  The user requested exactly 4 principles focused on:
  1. Code Quality
  2. Testing Standards
  3. User Experience Consistency
  4. Performance Requirements

  I'll adapt the template to have 4 principles (removing principle 5) and craft appropriate sections. Since this is a new constitution (version 1.0.0), the ratification date will be today.

      21  ## Core Principles
      22
      23 -### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
      24 -<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
      25 -[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
      26 -<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained,
         -independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->
      23 +### I. Code Quality
      24
      25 -### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
      26 -<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
      27 -[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
      28 -<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout,
         -errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->
      25 +All code MUST adhere to consistent quality standards that ensure maintainability, readability, and
         +reliability.
      26
      27 -### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
      28 -<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
      29 -[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
      30 -<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement;
         -Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->
      27 +- **Consistency**: Code MUST follow established style guides and linting rules. All team members MUST use
         +the same formatting tools configured identically.
      28 +- **Clarity**: Code MUST be self-documenting through meaningful names and clear structure. Comments are
         +reserved for explaining "why," not "what."
      29 +- **Modularity**: Functions and modules MUST have single, well-defined responsibilities. Dependencies
         +between components MUST be explicit and minimized.
      30 +- **No Dead Code**: Unused code, commented-out blocks, and unreachable branches MUST be removed. Version
         +control preserves history.
      31 +- **Error Handling**: All error paths MUST be explicitly handled. Silent failures are prohibited. Errors
         +MUST provide actionable context.
      32
      33 -### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
      34 -<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
      35 -[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
      36 -<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes,
         -Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->
      33 +**Rationale**: Consistent, high-quality code reduces cognitive load during reviews, accelerates
         +onboarding, and prevents defect accumulation.
      34
      35 -### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
      36 -<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
      37 -[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
      38 -<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format;
         -Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->
      35 +### II. Testing Standards
      36
      37 -## [SECTION_2_NAME]
      38 -<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->
      37 +Testing is non-negotiable. All features MUST be verified through automated tests before release.
      38
      39 -[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
      40 -<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->
      39 +- **Test-First Development**: For new features, tests MUST be written before implementation. Tests MUST
         +fail initially, then pass after implementation (Red-Green-Refactor).
      40 +- **Coverage Requirements**: Critical paths MUST have integration tests. Public APIs MUST have contract
         +tests. Edge cases and error conditions MUST be tested.
      41 +- **Test Independence**: Each test MUST be isolated and deterministic. Tests MUST NOT depend on execution
         +order or shared mutable state.
      42 +- **Meaningful Assertions**: Tests MUST verify behavior, not implementation details. Assertions MUST
         +clearly indicate what is being validated and why.
      43 +- **Continuous Verification**: All tests MUST pass before code is merged. Flaky tests MUST be fixed
         +immediately or quarantined with a remediation plan.
      44
      45 -## [SECTION_3_NAME]
      46 -<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->
      45 +**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing provides confidence for refactoring, documents expected behavior, and
         + catches regressions before users encounter them.
      46
      47 -[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
      48 -<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->
      47 +### III. User Experience Consistency
      48
      49 +Users MUST experience a coherent, predictable interface across all features and interactions.
      50 +
      51 +- **Design System Adherence**: All UI components MUST use established design tokens, patterns, and
         +components. Custom styling is prohibited without explicit approval.
      52 +- **Behavioral Consistency**: Similar actions MUST produce similar results. Navigation, feedback, and
         +interaction patterns MUST be uniform throughout the application.
      53 +- **Accessibility Requirements**: All features MUST meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Keyboard navigation,
         +screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast are mandatory.
      54 +- **Error Communication**: User-facing errors MUST be clear, actionable, and non-technical. Users MUST
         +always understand what went wrong and what they can do next.
      55 +- **State Feedback**: Users MUST always know the current system state. Loading indicators, success
         +confirmations, and progress updates are required for all asynchronous operations.
      56 +
      57 +**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user friction, builds trust, and decreases support burden.
         +Accessibility ensures the product serves all users.
      58 +
      59 +### IV. Performance Requirements
      60 +
      61 +Performance is a feature. All code MUST meet established performance budgets and constraints.
      62 +
      63 +- **Response Time Budgets**: User-initiated actions MUST respond within defined latency targets. Blocking
         +operations MUST NOT exceed acceptable thresholds without user notification.
      64 +- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage, CPU consumption, and network requests MUST be monitored and
         +bounded. Resource leaks are critical defects.
      65 +- **Scalability Awareness**: Code MUST be designed with scale in mind. O(n²) or worse algorithms require
         +explicit justification and approval for production use.
      66 +- **Measurement Before Optimization**: Performance improvements MUST be driven by profiling data, not
         +assumptions. Premature optimization without metrics is prohibited.
      67 +- **Degradation Prevention**: Performance regression tests MUST be included for critical paths. Changes
         +causing measurable degradation require justification.
      68 +
      69 +**Rationale**: Poor performance directly impacts user satisfaction and business metrics. Proactive
         +performance management prevents costly remediation.
      70 +
      71 +## Quality Gates
      72 +
      73 +All work MUST pass through established quality gates before completion.
      74 +
      75 +- **Pre-Commit**: Linting, formatting, and type checking MUST pass locally before commits.
      76 +- **Pre-Merge**: All automated tests MUST pass. Code review approval is required. No merge without passing
         + CI pipeline.
      77 +- **Pre-Release**: Integration tests, performance benchmarks, and accessibility audits MUST pass.
         +Stakeholder acceptance is required for user-facing changes.
      78 +
      79 +## Development Workflow
      80 +
      81 +The development process MUST follow these practices to maintain quality and velocity.
      82 +
      83 +- **Small, Focused Changes**: Pull requests MUST address a single concern. Large changes MUST be split
         +into reviewable increments.
      84 +- **Code Review Requirements**: All changes require review. Reviewers MUST verify adherence to these
         +principles. Authors MUST address all feedback or document disagreement rationale.
      85 +- **Documentation Updates**: User-facing changes MUST include documentation updates. API changes MUST
         +include updated contract specifications.
      86 +- **Regression Vigilance**: Bug fixes MUST include a test that would have caught the bug. Root cause
         +analysis is required for production incidents.
      87 +
      88  ## Governance

      92 +- **Supremacy**: Constitution principles supersede conflicting guidance in other documents. When in doubt,
         + this document governs.
      93 +- **Amendment Process**: Changes to this Constitution require documented rationale, team review, and
         +explicit approval. Amendments MUST include migration guidance for existing work.
      94 +- **Compliance Verification**: All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these
         +principles. Violations MUST be corrected before merge.
      95 +- **Versioning**: This Constitution follows semantic versioning. MAJOR changes remove or fundamentally
         +alter principles. MINOR changes add guidance or principles. PATCH changes clarify existing content.
      96 +- **Exception Process**: Temporary exceptions require documented justification, defined scope, and a
         +remediation timeline. Exceptions MUST be tracked and resolved.

  Summary

  New Version: 1.0.0 (initial creation)

  Version Bump Rationale: This is the initial constitution establishing all foundational principles, so version 1.0.0 is appropriate as the first stable release.

  Four Core Principles Established:

  1. Code Quality - Consistency, clarity, modularity, no dead code, explicit error handling
  2. Testing Standards - Test-first development, coverage requirements, test independence, meaningful assertions, continuous verification
  3. User Experience Consistency - Design system adherence, behavioral consistency, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, clear error communication, state feedback
  4. Performance Requirements - Response time budgets, resource efficiency, scalability awareness, measurement before optimization, degradation prevention

  Additional Sections:
  - Quality Gates: Pre-commit, pre-merge, and pre-release checkpoints
  - Development Workflow: Small changes, code review, documentation, regression vigilance
  - Governance: Supremacy, amendment process, compliance verification, semantic versioning, exception handling

  Template Compatibility:
  - plan-template.md: Compatible (Constitution Check section will use these principles)
  - spec-template.md: Compatible (Success Criteria aligns with performance/UX principles)
  - tasks-template.md: Compatible (test-first workflow explicitly supported)

  No files flagged for manual follow-up.

  Suggested commit message:
  docs: establish constitution v1.0.0 with code quality, testing, UX, and performance principles
